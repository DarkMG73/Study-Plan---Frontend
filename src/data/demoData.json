    "demonstratedskillsdesc": "The original version of The Interview Question Tool was limited and written in standard JavaScript and PHP with Google Firebase for the DB. This worked in an acceptable fashion, but it needed both a performance enhancement as well as a more maintainable structure and DB. There was no real backend, either, so I wanted that for better growth and maintainability. I was also wanting a visual overhaul that would be more soft and pleasing to look at for long periods of time.   The rebuild went well. The MongoDB database is a great improvement and the full Node.js backend API is smooth, performant and easily scalable. The React frontend is fast, well organized and provides an easy system for re-skinning this at any point. that last part will come in handy when adding a planned feature to let the user choose the theme that they will use, and allow them to change it at will to make long study sessions more enjoyable.  The rebuild also saw great new features like a Study Topic record for keeping track of areas the user needs to follow up on and a Study Notes section that keeps a running diary of failed and improved approaches to problems, reminders, thoughts or anything that helps the process.",

    "itemnotes": "Big hurdle to overcome: I wanted the tool to be useful wether the user has an account or not. The problem is that the user data is driven off of the DB and API. It made it a requirement that the tool would be flexible and smart enough to create teh same experience for the user regardless of the logged-in status. There was a good deal of complexity here as there is user notes on specific questions that have to be linked to the specific questions only for that user and everything had to persist through a refresh.  The complexity was resolved both by structuring a single object to hold all the non-common data that could be populated the same form either browser  or API storage. The functions were set up so that the system will run exactly the same, but, under the hood, the data gathering functions made the needed checks on user storage along with grooming the data in specific ways to output the same object each time. This meant, that a user could start not logged in, log in and log out and neither their browser storage nor DB storage would affect each other. The browser storage was Local Storage, so it will persist on that browser until the user wants to delete it via the tool.",

I attempted to solve the issue by diving deep into reading the screen width and making making the small adjustments needed. IN the end I realized I had shot right past the simple answer. The target cursor element was set for positionedfixed making it move relative to the window instead of the document. Position the target cursor to be relative to the document was not an option as it would move the element into the document. The answer was an obvious one position absolute. This removed the element form the doc flow and still kept its position relative to the document.",

This presented many challenges with the many different formats and approaches to the questions coming from a variety of different sources and the desire to make the content dynamically generated to avoid the static and boring nature of simple pre-sripted questions and answers. Ultimately the goal was to make a React interface that was exciting attractive and immersed the user in a Star Wars ambiance while delivering a unique and unpredictable question-answer game. While I wanted to find a way to use most of the facets of React contained in this comprehensive course I also wanted the effort to produce an enjoyable and useful app that can be grown into a larger theme-based challenge game. With diverse questions randomly selected dynamically created answer option logic careful theme-based graphics unexpected animations and a theme-based success hierarchy the Jedi Quiz Game accomplishes these goals while helping me cement a strong foundation in the React library.",

This was not hard but I also was tracking the used questions to be able to display the record of correct and incorrect question plus to ensure no questions were repeated. If I applied the filter to for example only show JavaScript and CSS questions the record would show more questions than had actually been answered in the current filtered set of questions. This meant the calculations were off on number of questions answered the percentage correct and the record display would show more than applied for the current questions set. I could have just linked each record list to the topic and level but that would then require filtering for every operation. I could have removed all questions from the record that did not match the current question set but then what if the user removed a topic and then added it back. The question from the removed topic would be removed from the record and then when the topic was added back it those questions would have to be answered again.\n     THE SOLUTION I simply would construct a new temporary record when a filter was applied or removed. This temp record would be the full record filtered based on current criteria. Since the original record is not altered questions would be removed and added back to the temp record as needed by the search. This meant the rest of the app could work with a single question set and record that would reflect the current filtered criteria and nothing more.",

We will start by exploring internal structure of the Git repository. You will learn that Git has 4 types of objects blobs trees commits and annotated tags. Each object has unique SHA1 hash. Also all objects are stored in the folders. Every object has just single reference to it - SHA1 hash. Files are stored in blobs. Filenames are stored in other Git objects called trees. I will explain you how to create new Git objects without using git commit and git add. After creating Git object in the Git repository you will checkout it to staging area and working directory opposite direction to traditional Git flow Afterwards we will jump into tons of practice activities and use different Git and GitHub features",

It will also link each to MDNs write-up on it if available.\n\nThere are lists on MDN and other places of objects and methods but I could not find anywhere with every object and every method all on one page so this tool was my answer to obtain that.\n\nIt will take about 4 - 7 minutes to complete its work.

This solutions required a lot of planning these chinks out and testing to get the balance right between the delays caused and frequency the screen needed to be updated. THis was not right for a project this small. \n\nService workers also got a look and would have been right for a larger more public-facing project. but not for this\n\nI ultimately just used a settimeout on each iteration with just enough time for the screen to update before running the process. This moved the main processing out of the main loop. thedownside is thescreen updates and loader animation are not as smooth as I would like but it works great for this plus is a small addition and so it is a lightweight solution.\n\n",

Why is this needed A typical slider will have a large center image and then tease the next and previous images be showing a tiny image or one that is cutoff or squished in some way. Some dont tease the previous or next image at all. Jumbotron 3D Silde Rotator uses the 3rd dimension to show the images completely and naturally while using a quarter of the space. The rotator can then turn to cycle through the images in a very expected and natural manner. Along with all of this 3D shapes and movement are eye catching and at this point not common so the entire page can become more memorable.",
